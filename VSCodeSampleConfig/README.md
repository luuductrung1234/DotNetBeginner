# VSCode Sample Configuration

just **copy** the content inside this directory and **paste** it input your `.vscode` directory. You need to config your own `input variables` in `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files.

# Notice

the `tasks` and `launch` configration is not stable depend on .NET Framework update and your projects directory structure. This configuration will be upgrade as soon as possible.
